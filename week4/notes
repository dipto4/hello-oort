This simulation consists of particles with mass. The mass of the disk is taken to be
0.1*M_Jupiter. Since mass of Jupiter is about 300 times the mass of earth, this implies that
the mass of the disk is around 30 times the mass of the earth with is consistent with
other simulations.

Both configurations will be used to perform this simulation.

CONFIGURATION 1 

Jupiter : 5 AU
Saturn : 7.5 AU
Neptune : 12.5 AU
Uranus : 15 AU
Disk : 16-40 AU

CONFIGURATION 2

Jupiter : 5.5AU
Saturn : 8 AU
Neptune : 11 AU
Uranus : 14 AU
Disk : 16-35 AU

Simulations will be performed for a period of 10 Myr or more.

Newer plotting scripts will be added later.
