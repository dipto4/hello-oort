Error stems from the fact that mercury removes a partice due to collision or large distance. The ID of that particle is still preserved 
by AMUSE and not removed. So when AMUSE tries to get the properties of a particle that was removed by mercury, it does not find the particle
in the mercury database, which throws off an error.


SOLUTION:
Not much of a bug fix, more of a hack.
The error code is -1. So when the particular function hits that error code, we change the value of the error code to 0. So the particle still gets written to the 
data file, but with xpos,ypos,zpos = 0 and vx,vy,vz = 0. 

OTHER (possible) BUGS:

1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0483.pdf mentions how the STAT array which takes care of the particle statuses in mercury6_2.for is not initialzied to zero.
This can present certain problems which starting new code if the code is compiled with gfortran or f77. Error is not present if we are using
other compilers like ifort. In other words, error is compiler dependent and should be fixed. Error was fixed by adding 3 lines of code
that initialized the particles. Bug has been known to remove particle in non-phyiscal ways.
