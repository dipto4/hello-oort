NOTES:
1. Shunned kepler as a whole. Used Vis-viva equation to figure out the semi-major
axis. Used semi-major axis to obtain eccentricity. Found inclination using maxwell's code.
2. Plotting inc vs. semi-major axis.

TODO:
1. Go over to SiMon repo and see what it's about.
2. Use 'nohup' command for ssh simulations.
3. Save data to hdf5 file instead of plotting it everytime. Make code modular and 
create another python script to plot data from said file. Improves performance.
4. Use Mercury() instead of MercuryInterface() or MercuryWayWard() as they are
legacy codes. 
5. USE UNITS!!!
6. new_solar_system() will take care of solar system and make code more concise.
