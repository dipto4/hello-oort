NOTES:

1. Run failed after 608 iterations as ssh pipeline broke.
2. Contains snapshots of test particles at the initial stage, intermediate stage
(0.51 Myr to 0.59 Myr).
3. Only plots the positions of the particles in the cartesian plane.
4. Does not plot inclination or semimajor axis as I could not run Kepler. 
5. Initial observations : A lot of particles seem to be at a higher distance from the 
sun.

TODO list: 
1. Find way to calculate semimajor axis without using Kepler. -- DONE (Vis-viva eqn) 
2. Make a table of how many particles are within a specified limit (like 100 AU, 1000 AU etc.) -- doing it in version 3 or 4
3. Find eccentricity without using Kepler. -- DONE
