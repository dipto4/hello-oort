NOTES

1. Original NMAX for mercury is 2000. Caused a lot of headache as to why code was not 
running. 
2. NMAX can be changed by going into mercury.inc
3. 10,000 particle simulation ongoing.
4. High inclination,semi major axis can be a result of gravitational slingshot by sun, planets.
5. Mercury does remove particles after a certain threshold.
6. Mercury does not remove particles after collision.
7. All orbiters now in prograde orbit.
8. Fixed issue with initial centripetal velocity. Turns out that the problem was 
in the direction of vx. A simple negative sign fixed the issue.

TODO: 
1. Write script to calculate inclination, eccentricity, semi-major axis from hdf5 data.
Plot the data.
